Summoning Structures adding to game useful Spawners (But its not dull spawners or sad mod with crafting default minecraft spawner block).  It`s multiblocks spawners. It has 6 (in this moment) multi-blocks spawners of mobs!


List mobs which you can spawning with mod Summoning Structures:
> Zombie
> PigZombie
> EnderMan
> Creeper
> Blaze
> Skeleton

To get started you need crafting blocks for creating Spawner:
> x8 Type of mob spawn block if you want spawning 
> x8 Base Block
> x8 Decalithium Bars
> x1 Spawner Core

 

Good luck with using mod!
